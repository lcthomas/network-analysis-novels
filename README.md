# network analysis and novels

A place for storing stuff I use when creating network models of novels. More on that later, maybe.

Right now, it only has 1 thing in it: a Jupyter notebook for cleaning up text tagged with Stanford's NER tagger. I used this to help create lists of characters in novels for a network analysis project. I'm still learning Python/programming in general, so none of this is good/efficient; the parts that are are taken from other people. It's also outdated, because it relies on Python 2. All of this and more is explained in the notebook itself. You can also read this post for more information: ["A messy and time-consuming way to create character lists using Stanford's NER tagger"](http://lindsaythomas.net/2018/09/creating-character-lists/).
- If you're not sure how to get a Jupyter notebook running on your machine, see the [Jupyter/IPython Notebook Quick Start Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
